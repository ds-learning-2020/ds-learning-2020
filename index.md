Ever wondered what might influence the pricing of a listing on Airbnb? When it might make more financial sense to plan a visit? 

Or, why all companies prefer to continue collecting seemingly endless amounts of data? Well, it's mostly so that they can answer questions like the ones above. 

In this quick post, I will aim to do the same. Airbnb, through [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com) and as part of their Inside Initiative, released a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data) describing listings in Seattle. 

I have analyzed the data, and aim to answer three questions based off of it below.


## 1. What is the average price of the listings in Seattle each month?

Some of us like to plan our travels well in advance, and sometimes knowing how the price of our stay fluctuates over time can be a huge benefit in saving costs. Keeping this in mind, I found out that the months of **June**, **July**, and **August**, have the highest average price (in dollars). 

| Month         | Average Price (dollars)|
| ------------- |:----------------------:|
| June          | 147.47                 | 
| July          | 152.09                 |
| August        | 150.66                 |

But wait! Before deciding on a month to travel to save some money, let's look at the distribution of the average prices. We can see that for some months the difference in prices might not be that drastic.

Looking at the above, January and February might be your best options to save some money.
